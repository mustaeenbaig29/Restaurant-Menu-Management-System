Hi,

First of all, thank you for assigning me this task. I have completed the assignment according to the instructions.

Here are the steps to run this project:

1. There will be two folders present:

   - Backend
   - Frontend

2. To run the project, you should be outside of these two folders. You should see these two folders named "Backend" and "Frontend."

3. In the VS Code terminal:

   For Frontend:
   ```
   cd frontend
   npm i
   npm start
   ```

   For Backend:
   ```
   cd backend
   npm i
   npx ts-node src/app.ts
   ```

Project Information:

Tech Stack Used:
- Front-end: React with TypeScript
- Back-end: Node.js with TypeScript
- Database: MongoDB
- APIs: RESTful

I have successfully implemented all the features:

- Dishes are displayed on the landing page.
- Users can create dishes.
- Users can click on "Edit Dish" to edit dish information, and the information is pre-filled.
- Users can delete dishes.

I have also added a feature to filter dishes based on cuisine.

If you encounter any issues with the backend regarding MongoDB, please don't hesitate to reach out. Your feedback on this assignment is highly appreciated.
